## 🏥 The Problem: "The Hospital Bottleneck"

In many medical facilities, the transition between patient arrival and bed assignment is plagued by communication gaps. The core issues include:

**Information Asymmetry:** Doctors and nurses often don't have real-time visibility into which beds are available across different departments (ICU, Cardiology, etc.).  
**Manual Tracking Errors:** Relying on physical charts or verbal updates for patient discharges leads to "ghost beds"—beds that are empty but marked as occupied.  
**Safety Hazards:** Lack of standardized ward assignments can lead to staff burnout and delayed patient care when medical roles are not properly synchronized with departmental needs.
